The main character of this story is Julian Mantle, an enormously successful lawyer. His outrageous courtroom theatrics regularly made the front pages of the newspaper.

It's a story about the transformation of 53-year-old Julian into a man who looks like 30 without any wrinkles on his face. Julian came to his country and met his old friend and colleague John. Julian shared his story and experience with his friend.   

Robin Sharma shows a path of enlightenment through seven timeless virtue and symbols. This story tells you how to master your mind, follow your purpose, practice Kaizen, live with discipline, respect your time, selflessly serve others, and embrace the present.

The story has a single POV. It is slow-paced, and a few times, it makes me bored. The characters are a little bit dull. Julian is considered a litigator, while John wants to understand his friend's shared. This book fills with different examples and stories to understand the meaning of life. Julian learned these things from the Sages of Sivana in India. The story definitely left an impact on readers. This book encourages you to follow your calling and do what makes you happy. It is a recommendable read.
